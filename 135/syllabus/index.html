    <h4>
        Course Description
    </h4>

    <p>
        An introduction to software development, using the C++ programming language.
        Software development is a skill that involves solving real-world problems by
        developing computer programs. Breaking a problem down, then creating a series
        of logical steps (an algorithm) that solves the problem is the conceptual part
        of the course. The technical component involves translating the solution into a
        working computer program. A successful student will be able to clearly and
        logically develop an algorithmic solution to a problem, while being comfortable
        enough with C++ to transform the algorithm into a working computer program.

    <h4>
        Academic Integrity
    </h4>

    <p>
        Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism,
        cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification
        of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values
        of intellectual honesty. The college is committed to enforcing the CUNY
        Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty
        according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.

    </p>
    <p>
        The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is strictly prohibited in all
        coursework and assignments. This includes, but is not limited to, the
        use of AI-generated text, speech, or images, as well as the use of AI
        tools or software to complete any portion of a project or assignment.
        Any violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up
        to and including a failing grade for the assignment or course. Our goal
        is to encourage critical thinking and creativity, and the use of AI detracts
        from this objective. Students are expected to use their own knowledge,
        research and analysis to complete coursework.
    </p>

    <p>
        On a more practical note, this class is a very early class in your computer
        science journey. Most of these assignments are incredibly trivial to do with
        AI, but they are equivalent to learning your ABC's and your multiplication tables.
        To use AI in your assignments at this stage, will do nothing but leave you
        underprepared for coursework and projects where AI cannot help (which will
        happen much sooner than later!). I implore you to put in the requisite sweat
        and effort for this class, for the sake of your own growth as engineers and
        computer scientists.

    </h4>
