          <div>
            computer science capstone project. me and two teammates built an emulator
            for the Chip-8, a fully online interface for the emulator, a debugger, and an
            IDE. The debugger consists of a UI that displays the currently executing ROM,
            the CPU register states, and the ability to adjust CPU speed in real-time.
            The IDE features an assembler that compiles source code directly into the
            web emulator, and additional tooling to aid in development. The frontend
            was implemented in Svelte, with the emulator implemented in AssemblyScript
            that compiled to WebAssembly.

            1kv is a still under development showcase of all my destiny 2 clips, complete with descriptions of why
            something was clip-worthy. build with sveletekit, it queries into my CMS (https://strapi.moodyrahman.com/)
            at compile time and generates all the HTML then (SSG). the ultimate goal for this project is to design a
            pipeline such that I can upload a clip, and it'll automatically compress the video, generate a thumbnail for
            it, and create its corresponding entry in the CMS.

            Thinking about porting it over to use youtube instead of hosting the clips here because YT is so much better
            at handling videos than me.

            this is a little utility that helps me rapidly try new colors without needing to write css.
            it also encodes a given palette into the URL, creating a hard URL for any and every palette.

            autoindexed directories are pretty ugly, as anyone who's ever browsed a package repo is painfully aware of.
            one of the more well documented ways of styling an nginx generated autoindexed directory is via XSLT
            (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations). here is the xslt code I wrote to handle my file server.
